NRL DataJam is a hackathon held every year where teams are tasked with creating and presenting a Rugby League analytics solution to the NRL. The data provided includes game event data and player GPS positional data. In 2019, our team's solution was a tool which helps inform coaches whether to opt for the penalty goal (2pts) or to attack for the try (6pt potential). Against 9 other teams, our team was awarded 3rd place for our solution, which included a tableau dashboard tool intended for coaches.
