### Real-time Facial Emotion Recognition

[Real-time Facial Emotion Recognition](https://github.com/martycheung/CppND-Facial-Emotion-Recognition)
A real-time facial emotion recognition app which uses your laptop's camera feed to detect faces and then classifies the facial expression (eg. happy, sad, surprise angry etc.). A simple convolutional network model was built using Keras/Tensorflow (Python) and then deployed using OpenCV in C++. This project was done as the capstone project in the Udacity C++ Nanodegree.

NRL DataJam is a hackathon held every year where teams are tasked with creating and presenting a Rugby League analytics solution to the NRL. The data provided includes game event data and player GPS positional data. In 2019, our team's solution was a tool which helps inform coaches whether to opt for the penalty goal (2pts) or to attack for the try (6pt potential). Against 9 other teams, our team was awarded 3rd place for our solution, which included a tableau dashboard tool intended for coaches.

### Real Estate Valuation Model

This is a personal project where I am building a dataset and tool to help inform my property investment decisions in the future. The project involves web scraping data from realestate.com.au and other property sites, and then building a model to recommend property value, given preporty size, location, bedrooms, etc.
