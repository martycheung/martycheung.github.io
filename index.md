### [Real-time Facial Emotion Recognition](https://github.com/martycheung/CppND-Facial-Emotion-Recognition)

A real-time facial emotion recognition app which uses your laptop's camera feed to detect faces and then classifies the facial expression (eg. happy, sad, surprise angry etc.). A simple convolutional network model was built using Keras/Tensorflow (Python) and then deployed using OpenCV in C++.

Tech: Keras, Tensorflow, OpenCV, Python, C++

### [NRL DataJam 2019](https://github.com/martycheung/NRL-DataJam-2019)

NRL DataJam is a hackathon held every year where teams are tasked with creating and presenting a Rugby League analytics solution to the NRL. In 2019, our team's solution was a tool which helps inform coaches whether to opt for the penalty goal (2pts) or to attack for the try (up to 6pts). Our team was awarded 3rd place for our solution, which included a tableau dashboard tool intended for coaches.  

Tech: R, Tableau

### [Real Estate Valuation Model](https://github.com/martycheung/Real-Estate-Dataset-and-Valuation-Model)

This is a personal project where I am building a dataset and tool to help inform my property investment decisions in the future. The project involves web scraping data from realestate.com.au and other property sites, and then building a model to estimate property value, given property size, location, bedrooms, etc.  

Tech: Python, Selenium, Beautiful Soup

### [IEEE-CIS Fraudulent Transactions (Kaggle)](https://github.com/martycheung/IEEE-CIS-Fraudulent-Transactions-Kaggle)

This is a Kaggle competition where I am building predictive models to detect fraudulent card transactions. Features in the dataset include the transaction time and amount, product code, card type, geography, email domain, device and a number of pre-built features by the competition hosts. For the competition, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection (feature importance and RFE) and building models using gradient boosted trees (Xgboost, LightGBM), and even briefly tried neural networks.

Tech: Python

### [Quora Insincere Questions Text Classification (Kaggle)](https://github.com/martycheung/Quora-Insincere-Questions-Kaggle)

Quora Insincere Questions was a popular Kaggle competition, involving detecting which questions posed on Quora were insincere. In this challenge, I started off using a simple model baseline using bag of words features, and then improved upon my results using Deep Learning models.

Tech: Python, NLP

### [HuffPost News Category Text Classification](https://github.com/martycheung/Quora-Insincere-Questions-Kaggle)

This was a dataset that someone put up on Kaggle (not a competition), which consisted of headlines and short descriptions of articles which were scraped from HuffPost. Each example was linked to a news category (eg. politics, sport, business, entertainment, world news etc.), and so the challenge was to classify each text into one news category. I used this project to experiment with traditional text pre-processing methods, EDA and simple NLP models.

Tech: Python, NLP
