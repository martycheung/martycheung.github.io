### [Real-time Facial Emotion Recognition](https://github.com/martycheung/CppND-Facial-Emotion-Recognition)

A real-time facial emotion recognition app which uses your laptop's camera feed to detect faces and then classifies the facial expression (eg. happy, sad, surprised, angry, etc.). A convolutional network model was built using Keras/Tensorflow (Python) and then deployed using OpenCV in C++.

### [IEEE-CIS Fraudulent Transactions (Kaggle)](https://github.com/martycheung/IEEE-CIS-Fraudulent-Transactions-Kaggle)

Kaggle competition to build models to detect fraudulent card transactions. Features in the dataset include the transaction time and amount, product code, card type, geography, email domain, device and a number of pre-built features by the competition hosts.

**Tech:** Python, Xgboost/LightGBM

### [Quora Insincere Questions Text Classification (Kaggle)](https://github.com/martycheung/Quora-Insincere-Questions-Kaggle)

Kaggle competition which involved using NLP methods to detect which questions posed on Quora were insincere. I started off using a simple model baseline using bag of words and TFIDF features, and then improved upon my results using Deep Learning models.

**Tech:** Python, NLP

### [Real Estate Valuation Web Scraping and Model](https://github.com/martycheung/Real-Estate-Dataset-and-Valuation-Model)

I am scraping a dataset and building a tool to help inform my personal property investment decisions. The project involves web scraping data from realestate.com.au and other property sites, and then building a model to estimate property value, given property size, location, bedrooms, etc.  

**Tech:** Python, Selenium, Beautiful Soup

### [HuffPost News Category Text Classification (Kaggle)](https://github.com/martycheung/Quora-Insincere-Questions-Kaggle)

A public dataset on Kaggle (not a competition), which consisted of headlines and short descriptions of articles which were scraped from HuffPost. The challenge was to classify each text into a news category, eg. politics, sport, business, entertainment, world news etc.

**Tech:** Python, NLP
